# Iris Dataset Analysis (Classification)

In this Project we doing the basic Analysis of Iris Dataset which is a very popular Dataset. We have used different classification Algorithm to Predict the Species in the Dataet. 


# Dataset

Dataset includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species

- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Algorithm 

Below algorithms was used in the Project. 

- Logistic Regresssion
- K-nearest neighbours (KNN)

# Learning from the Project 

Have tried different algorithms for prediction. This was a simple and clean dataset so model was able to get 100 % accuracy without much hypertunning. Was able to basic model prediction using differnt classification algorithms.
