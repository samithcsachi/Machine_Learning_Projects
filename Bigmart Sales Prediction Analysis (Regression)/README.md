# Bigmart Sales Prediction Analysis (Regression)

In this project we are trying to predict Bigmart Sales Prediction Analysis using python language. We have used different classification Algorithm to Predict the loan approval status in the Dataset. 

# Dataset

The dataset contains the  Bigmart Sales.
