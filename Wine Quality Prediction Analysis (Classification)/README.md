# Wine Quality Prediction Analysis (Classification)

In this project we are trying to predict Quality of wine using python language. We have used different classification Algorithm to Predict the predict Quality of wine in the Dataset. 

# Dataset

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine was combined.  These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

# Libraries

Below libraries was used for the visualization and model training. 

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


# Algorithm 

Below algorithms was used in the Project. 

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees Classifier 
- xgboost 
- lightgbm


# Learning from the Project 

- Have tried different algorithms for prediction. 
- Log Transformation
- Min -Max Normalization
- Removing the outliers
- Class Imbalancement Method 

# Conclusion  

In this Notebook we have got the maximum accuracy of 91.09 % for Extra Trees Classifier algorithm and CV score of 84.96 % was achieved. We can use more oversampling method to increase the accuracy.
