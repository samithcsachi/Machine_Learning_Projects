# Obesity Prediction Analysis (Classification)

In this project we are trying to predict Obesity using python language. We have used different classification Algorithm to Predict the predict Obesity in the Dataset. 

# Dataset

This dataset helps estimate obesity levels based on eating habits, family history and physical condition. It includes data from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, covering 16 lifestyle and health-related features with 2111 records. The labels classify obesity levels, ranging from underweight to different obesity types.

# Libraries

Below libraries was used for the visualization and model training. 

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


# Algorithm 

Below algorithms was used in the Project. 

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees Classifier 
- xgboost 
- lightgbm


# Learning from the Project 

- Have tried different algorithms for prediction. 
- Removing the outliers


# Conclusion  

Clearly LightGBM is the best model with Accuracy of 98.01 % and CV Score of 95.72%. Accuracy can be furhter improved by GridSearchCV or Optuna.
