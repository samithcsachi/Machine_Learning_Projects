# Loan Prediction Analysis  (Classification)

In this Project we doing the basic Analysis and trying to predict the loan approval status. We have used different classification Algorithm to Predict the loan approval status in the Dataset. 


# Dataset

Dataset includes details of the customers which are factor for approving the loan. 

The columns in this dataset are:

- Loan_ID            
- Gender               
- Married               
- Dependents           
- Education            
- Self_Employed        
- ApplicantIncome       
- CoapplicantIncome     
- LoanAmount           
- Loan_Amount_Term     
- Credit_History       
- Property_Area        
- Loan_Status
