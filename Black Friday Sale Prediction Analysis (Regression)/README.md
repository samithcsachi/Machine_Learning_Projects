# Black Friday Sales Prediction Analysis (Regression)

In this project we are trying to predict Sales Prediction using python language. We have used different Regression Algorithm to Predict the predict Sales in the Dataset. 

# Dataset

This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. It‚Äôs a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.

# Libraries

Below libraries was used for the visualization and model training. 

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


# Algorithm 

Below algorithms was used in the Project. 

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees Classifier 
- Ridge 
- Lasso 


# Learning from the Project 

- Have tried different algorithms for prediction. 
- Removing the outliers


# Conclusion  

Clearly Decision Tree Regressor is the best model with MSE of 3370.56 and CV Score of 3337.78.  Lower MSE and CV score is the criteria of best model.
