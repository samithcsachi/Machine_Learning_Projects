# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis (Regression)

In this project we are trying to predict Bike Sharing Demand using python language. We have used different Regression Algorithm to Predict the predict Bike Sharing Demand in the Dataset. 

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

# Dataset

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to  
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.

# Libraries

Below libraries was used for the visualization and model training. 

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


# Algorithm 

Below algorithms was used in the Project. 

- Linear Regression
- Ridge
- HuberRegressor
- ElasticNetCV
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Extra Tree Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- xgboost 
- lightgbm


# Learning from the Project 

- Have tried different algorithms for prediction. 
- Removing the outliers


# Conclusion  

Since we are using neg_mean_squared_error so lower CV score means better. So the best model is LGBMRegressor with the CV score of 0.19197.
